# Coin the Catch
In Russia, the coin collects you
(Made for Seige, October 2025)

# About
Coin the Catch is an inversion of the classic coin-catching mechanic. In this game, you play as a coin collecting human players scattered throughout the map. At the end, you can finish the game by touching The Ominous Orb(tm) (patent pending).

# Ok but why
I had this idea in a dream (no I am not kidding), then promptly sat on it for about 8 months. I decided that with the current Seige theme, I might as well put this to use.
